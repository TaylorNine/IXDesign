        <h2>WHO IS TAYLOR FEDT?</h2>
        <p>I am a User Experience Designer and Front-End Developer from Minneapolis, MN. I've always been naturally
          inquisitive and loved anything that combined art and technology. When I was about 11 or 12-years old, I discovered
          that I could download Macromedia Fireworks for free. A few weeks later I completed my first
          prototype for what soon after became my first website. Coincidentally this was also when my parents received a letter
          from our ISP regarding my questionable usage of dial-up bandwith. The rest, as they say, is history.
